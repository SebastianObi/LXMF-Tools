# lxmf_ping
This program sends an adjustable number of LXMF messages to a destination. Then a simple statistic is created to check the success or failure of a single message. This tool can be useful to load the LXMF/Reticulum network with a defined load of messages. This can be used to simulate a certain amount of users.

For more information, see the configuration options (at the end of the program files). Everything else is briefly documented there. After the first start this configuration will be created as default config in the corresponding file.


### Features
- Compatible with all LXMF applications (NomadNet, Sideband, ...)


## Examples of use

### 

### General info how the messages are transported
All messages between client<->server are transported as single 1:1 messages in the LXMF/Reticulum network.
Accordingly, encryption takes place between these end points.
If a direct delivery of the message does not work, it is sent to a propagation node. There it is stored temporarily and can be retrieved by the client later.

As these are normal LXMF messages, any LXMF capable application can be used to communicate with the group.


## Current Status
It should currently be considered beta software and still work in progress.

All core features are implemented and functioning, but additions will probably occur as real-world use is explored.

There may be errors or the compatibility after an update is no longer guaranteed.

The full documentation is not yet available. Due to lack of time I can also not say when this will be further processed.
